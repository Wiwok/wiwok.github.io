					<p>
						Hi! I'm Émile, a French developer since 2015. Over the years, I've had the privilege to engage
						with an extensive array of technologies. From pioneering web tools like ThreeJS and React, to
						harnessing the power of the Unity game engine, and crafting desktop applications using
						ElectronJS, I've delved into diverse realms. Moreover, my adeptness in programming languages,
						spanning from Batch, HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Java, SQL, C, C++, Rust and beyond, highlights my
						adaptability in the technical sphere. This breadth of expertise empowers me to creatively tackle
						the myriad challenges inherent in my projects.

It's a WebApp built in React along with a data server utilizing ExpressJS and MongoDB. Given the critical importance of data privacy and integrity, numerous security measures have been implemented. The software can be summarized as a phone number distributor, allowing multiple employees to simultaneously call multiple phone numbers without ever dialing the same number twice."

It's more of a proof of concept than a full-fledged software, although it remains perfectly functional. This tool allows for the installation and updating of mods for the video game Factorio, bypassing the system and protections of the official Factorio API. Therefore, it's possible to use mods without owning an official game license."
